Prompt: I have a remote repository via GitHub classroom and would like to add specific files from another remote repository on GitHub to it. How would I best accomplish this?

Output: Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very practical (and slightly tricky) Git workflow question.

Let‚Äôs restate your situation first:

* You have a **main remote repo** (from GitHub Classroom) ‚Äî let‚Äôs call it `origin`.
* You want to bring **specific files or folders** from **another remote GitHub repo** ‚Äî let‚Äôs call that `source-repo`.
* You **don‚Äôt want** to clone everything from `source-repo` or merge its entire history.

Here are the **best options**, depending on what you need:

---

## üß© Option 1: **Use `git sparse-checkout` with the source repo**

This is the cleanest way to pull *specific files* from another repo into your Classroom repo, while keeping full Git control.

### Steps

1. From your Classroom repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-CLASSROOM-ORG/YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO.git
   cd YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO
   ```

2. Add the other repo as a temporary remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add source https://github.com/username/source-repo.git
   ```

3. Use sparse-checkout to pull only what you need:

   ```bash
   git fetch source
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/
   git checkout source/main -- path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/
   ```

4. Commit and push the imported files to your Classroom repo:

   ```bash
   git add path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/
   git commit -m "Add selected files from source-repo"
   git push origin main
   ```

‚úÖ *Pros:*

* Only downloads specific files.
* Keeps clean commit history in your repo.
* Doesn‚Äôt clone or merge the entire source repo.

‚ùå *Cons:*

* Slightly more setup.
* Requires Git ‚â• 2.25.

---

## üì¶ Option 2: **Download specific files directly and commit them**

If you don‚Äôt need to preserve history, and you only want the file contents:

1. Use `curl` or `wget` with the raw GitHub URL:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/source-repo/main/path/to/file.py
   ```

2. Then move that file into your Classroom repo directory, add, commit, and push:

   ```bash
   git add path/to/file.py
   git commit -m "Add file.py from source-repo"
   git push origin main
   ```

‚úÖ *Pros:*

* Fast and dead simple.
* Great for a few files.

‚ùå *Cons:*

* Loses commit history.
* Manual process if you need many files.

---

## üß≠ Option 3: **Use `git subtree` or `git filter-repo` (advanced)**

If you want to *preserve the file‚Äôs original history* from the source repo, you can pull it in with `git subtree` or `git filter-repo`.

For example:

```bash
git remote add source https://github.com/username/source-repo.git
git fetch source main
git subtree add --prefix=external_files source main --squash
```

‚úÖ *Pros:*

* Keeps history (or a squashed version).
* Good if you‚Äôll update those files later from the source.

‚ùå *Cons:*

* More complex, overkill if you just want to copy files once.

## ü™Ñ My recommendation

| Use Case                                   | Recommended Method                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Just need file contents                    | ‚úÖ Option 2 ‚Äî `curl` the raw files        |
| Need to use Git tools & keep project clean | ‚úÖ Option 1 ‚Äî `sparse-checkout`           |
| Need to preserve history from source repo  | ‚öôÔ∏è Option 3 ‚Äî `subtree` or `filter-repo` |

---

Would you like me to show a **copy-pasteable example** using real folder names (e.g., importing a folder like `utils/` or a file like `data/cleaner.py` from another GitHub repo into your Classroom repo)? That would make it crystal clear.

Prompt: Is path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/ a specific command or is it something general that I need to fill out/define myself?

Output: Excellent question ‚Äî and it‚Äôs an important one üëç

üëâ `path/to/file1.py` and `path/to/folder/` are **not literal commands** ‚Äî they‚Äôre **placeholders** that **you replace** with the *actual paths* of the files or folders you want to copy from the other repository.

---

### üí° Example

Let‚Äôs say the repository you want to pull from is:

```
https://github.com/exampleuser/cool-project
```

and inside it, you want to copy these:

```
cool-project/src/utils/math_tools.py
cool-project/data/example_data/
```

Then the commands would look like this:

```bash
git sparse-checkout set src/utils/math_tools.py data/example_data/
git checkout source/main -- src/utils/math_tools.py data/example_data/
```

Here:

* `src/utils/math_tools.py` ‚Üí is the **actual file path** in the source repo.
* `data/example_data/` ‚Üí is the **actual folder path** in the source repo.

---

### üß≠ How to find the correct path

1. Go to the file or folder on GitHub.
2. Look at the URL ‚Äî for example:

   ```
   https://github.com/exampleuser/cool-project/blob/main/src/utils/math_tools.py
   ```

   The part after `blob/main/` is your path:

   ```
   src/utils/math_tools.py
   ```

That‚Äôs what you insert into the command.

---

### üß© Quick recap

| Placeholder        | You replace it with                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `path/to/file1.py` | the exact relative path to the file you want   |
| `path/to/folder/`  | the exact relative path to the folder you want |

---

Would you like to tell me the exact repo and files you want to import (just the GitHub URLs)?
I can show you the *exact commands* you‚Äôd run with those filled in correctly.

Prompt: This is the repo I want to pull from https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial.git and I would like to pull the files BBH_events_v3.json
GW150914_4_template.hdf5
H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5
L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 
as well as the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb notebook and the readligo.py utility file.

Output: Perfect üëç ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very clear setup. You have your **GitHub Classroom repo** (your working repository) and you want to **pull 6 specific files** from:

üëâ [`https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial`](https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial)

Here‚Äôs exactly how to do this cleanly **without cloning the entire source repo**, using a single `git sparse-checkout` workflow.

---

## ‚úÖ **Option 1: Git sparse-checkout method (recommended if you want to preserve Git use)**

### Step-by-step

1. Go to (or clone) your **GitHub Classroom repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-CLASSROOM-ORG/YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO.git
cd YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO
```

2. Add the LOSC tutorial repo as a **temporary remote**:

```bash
git remote add losc https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial.git
```

3. **Fetch** from that remote (so you can access its files):

```bash
git fetch losc
```

4. Initialize **sparse-checkout**:

```bash
git sparse-checkout init --cone
```

5. Tell Git which files you want (these are the *exact paths* in that repo):

```bash
git sparse-checkout set \
    BBH_events_v3.json \
    GW150914_4_template.hdf5 \
    H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb \
    readligo.py
```

6. **Check out** those files from the `main` branch of the LOSC repo:

```bash
git checkout losc/main -- \
    BBH_events_v3.json \
    GW150914_4_template.hdf5 \
    H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb \
    readligo.py
```

7. **Commit and push** the files into your Classroom repo:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add LOSC tutorial files from gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial"
git push origin main
```

‚úÖ Done!
Now those files are part of your GitHub Classroom repository, without cloning or merging the entire tutorial repo.

---

## üß© **Option 2: Simple one-off download (no Git integration)**

If you just want the files, you can also directly download them with `curl`:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/BBH_events_v3.json
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/GW150914_4_template.hdf5
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/readligo.py
```

Then move them into your Classroom repo folder and push as usual.

‚ùóNote:
Some `.hdf5` binary files are large ‚Äî if you use `curl`, make sure your connection doesn‚Äôt time out or truncate them.

---

## üß≠ Recommendation

| Goal                   | Best Method              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Keep using Git cleanly | ‚úÖ Sparse-checkout method |
| Quick manual copy      | ‚ö° Curl download          |

---

Would you like me to show a small **Bash script** version that automates this sparse-checkout process (so you can rerun it easily in the future)?

Prompt: (notebook) jovyan@jupyter-e-briel---8ada04b7:~/hw-2-e-briel$ git add ligotools/
The following paths and/or pathspecs matched paths that exist
outside of your sparse-checkout definition, so will not be
updated in the index:
ligotools/readligo.py
hint: If you intend to update such entries, try one of the following:
hint: * Use the --sparse option.
hint: * Disable or modify the sparsity rules.
hint: Disable this message with "git config set advice.updateSparsePath false"

I have created a new folder to hold the .py file that was pulled earlier and am attempting to add it to my commit for my personal remote GitHub repo and this message came up. What does this mean?

Output: Excellent ‚Äî you‚Äôre actually bumping into a *quirk* of how `git sparse-checkout` works.
Let‚Äôs unpack this carefully, because it‚Äôs a **very common confusion** when mixing sparse-checkout with new local files üëá

---

### üß† What‚Äôs happening

You‚Äôre seeing:

```
The following paths and/or pathspecs matched paths that exist
outside of your sparse-checkout definition, so will not be
updated in the index:
ligotools/readligo.py
```

That means:

> Git‚Äôs **sparse-checkout configuration** currently tells Git:
> ‚ÄúOnly track these specific paths from the working tree.‚Äù
>
> And right now, your new folder `ligotools/` (and its file) **is not included** in that sparse-checkout list ‚Äî so Git is **ignoring** it when you try `git add`.

Essentially:
üö´ Git: ‚ÄúThat file isn‚Äôt in the list of files I‚Äôm managing under sparse-checkout, so I won‚Äôt track it.‚Äù

---

### üß© How to fix it

You have 3 valid options ‚Äî depending on how you want to handle your repo.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Temporarily disable sparse-checkout**

This lets Git behave normally again (track *everything* in your working directory):

```bash
git sparse-checkout disable
```

Then you can just:

```bash
git add ligotools/readligo.py
git commit -m "Add readligo.py to ligotools folder"
git push origin main
```

This is the **simplest and cleanest** option if you‚Äôre done pulling files from the other repo and just want to resume normal Git behavior.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Option 2: Add your new folder to the sparse-checkout definition**

If you still want sparse-checkout active, but just want to include this new folder, run:

```bash
git sparse-checkout set ligotools/
```

Then Git will expand its working set to include everything under `ligotools/`, and you can safely add and commit the file:

```bash
git add ligotools/readligo.py
git commit -m "Add readligo.py"
git push origin main
```

---

#### üß© **Option 3: Use `--sparse` when adding**

Git gives you this hint:

```
hint: * Use the --sparse option.
```

That means you can *force* Git to stage the file even if it‚Äôs outside the sparse paths:

```bash
git add --sparse ligotools/readligo.py
```

Then commit and push as usual.

‚úÖ Works fine for small changes.
‚ùó But if you plan to do a lot more work, it‚Äôs usually easier to disable sparse-checkout entirely.

---

### üß≠ TL;DR ‚Äî What you should probably do

If you‚Äôre done importing files from the other repo:

```bash
git sparse-checkout disable
git add ligotools/readligo.py
git commit -m "Add readligo.py to my repo"
git push origin main
```

That will re-enable normal Git behavior for your Classroom repo, and you won‚Äôt see that message again.

---

Would you like me to show you what your `.git/info/sparse-checkout` file currently contains? That‚Äôs the file that defines which paths are active, and it‚Äôs helpful to understand what Git is using behind the scenes.


Prompt: I noticed in my repo on GitHub that none of my tags are appearing. I am using git tag <tag name> as the method to add tags.

Output: Good catch ‚Äî this is a *very common* source of confusion with Git tags, especially when working with GitHub.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on üëá

---

## üß† What‚Äôs happening

When you run:

```bash
git tag <tagname>
```

You are creating a **local tag only** ‚Äî it exists only in your local `.git` metadata.

By default, **Git does not automatically push tags** when you push commits.
That‚Äôs why your tags don‚Äôt appear on GitHub yet ‚Äî they haven‚Äôt been uploaded.

---

## ‚úÖ How to push tags to GitHub

There are two main ways to do it, depending on what you want:

---

### Option 1: Push a specific tag

If you just created one tag (say `v1.0`):

```bash
git push origin v1.0
```

This sends only that single tag to your GitHub remote (`origin`).

---

### Option 2: Push all local tags

If you‚Äôve created multiple tags and want them all to appear on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin --tags
```

This uploads **every tag** in your local repo that doesn‚Äôt yet exist on GitHub.

---

### Option 3 (optional): Check which tags exist locally

Before pushing, you can verify what tags exist:

```bash
git tag
```

That lists all your local tags.

You can also check which tags exist remotely:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin
```

That shows which tags GitHub currently knows about.

---

## üß© Summary

| Goal             | Command                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Create a tag     | `git tag v1.0`                |
| Push one tag     | `git push origin v1.0`        |
| Push all tags    | `git push origin --tags`      |
| List local tags  | `git tag`                     |
| List remote tags | `git ls-remote --tags origin` |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bonus Tip: Annotated vs. lightweight tags

If you want your tags to appear more clearly in GitHub‚Äôs UI (with description, author, date), make them **annotated tags**:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```

GitHub treats annotated tags as proper ‚Äúreleases,‚Äù while lightweight tags are just pointers to commits.

---

Would you like me to show how to **turn your existing lightweight tags into annotated ones** (so they show up properly in GitHub‚Äôs ‚ÄúReleases‚Äù tab)?

Prompt: I would like to check the package version of scipy from another notebook. The notebook uses the imports "from scipy import signal", "from scipy.interpolate import interp1d", etc and I received the following error when attempting to use __version__ to check the version history:
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[5], line 1
----> 1 scipy.__version__

NameError: name 'scipy' is not defined

AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[6], line 1
----> 1 signal.__version__

AttributeError: module 'scipy.signal' has no attribute '__version__'

Output: Excellent observation ‚Äî this behavior is **exactly what we‚Äôd expect** given how the imports are done. Let‚Äôs unpack it:

---

### üß† Why you‚Äôre getting that error

In your notebook, you said you imported:

```python
from scipy import signal
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
```

That means:

* You imported **specific submodules** (`signal`, `interpolate`) and a function (`interp1d`),
* But you **did not import the root `scipy` module** itself.

So, when you later run:

```python
scipy.__version__
```

Python says:

```
NameError: name 'scipy' is not defined
```

because the name `scipy` doesn‚Äôt exist in your namespace.

And when you try:

```python
signal.__version__
```

you get:

```
AttributeError: module 'scipy.signal' has no attribute '__version__'
```

because the version attribute only exists at the **top-level package** (`scipy`), not in submodules like `scipy.signal`.

---

### ‚úÖ How to check the SciPy version correctly

You have a few options depending on how you want to do it:

#### **Option 1 ‚Äî Import `scipy` and check the version**

Just add this line in your notebook:

```python
import scipy
print(scipy.__version__)
```

That‚Äôs the most straightforward and canonical way.

---

#### **Option 2 ‚Äî Use `pip show` (from a notebook or terminal)**

From inside a notebook cell:

```python
!pip show scipy
```

or just in a terminal:

```bash
pip show scipy
```

This shows the installed version, location, and dependencies.

---

#### **Option 3 ‚Äî Use `importlib.metadata` (Python ‚â• 3.8)**

If you want to avoid importing SciPy directly:

```python
from importlib.metadata import version
print(version("scipy"))
```

This reads the version metadata from the installed package.

---

### üß© Summary

| Command                               | Works?                              | Description                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `scipy.__version__`                   | ‚úÖ Yes (if you `import scipy` first) | Standard way                             |
| `signal.__version__`                  | ‚ùå No                                | Submodules don‚Äôt have version attributes |
| `!pip show scipy`                     | ‚úÖ Yes                               | Shell-based method                       |
| `importlib.metadata.version("scipy")` | ‚úÖ Yes                               | Pure Python method (no import)           |

---

**Recommended:**
Just add one line at the top or bottom of your notebook:

```python
import scipy
print("SciPy version:", scipy.__version__)
```

Would you like me to show a short snippet that automatically prints the version of *all* key packages in your notebook (like `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`)? That can be handy for reproducibility.

looking for, navigate to

    https://anaconda.org

and use the search bar at the top of the page.

Output: Excellent ‚Äî this error message is very informative, and it‚Äôs one that comes up often when building environments for coursework.

Let‚Äôs break it down carefully üëá

---

## üß† What‚Äôs going on

Conda is telling you:

```
PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - readligo=0.6*
  - json=2.0*
```

That means:

* Conda searched all your listed channels (`conda-forge`, `defaults`, etc.)
* It could **not find any conda package** named `readligo` or `json` with those version patterns.

---

### üß© The root cause

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`readligo` is *not* a published conda package**

It‚Äôs a **local Python module** from the [LOSC tutorial repo](https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial), not something available on conda-forge or PyPI.

You‚Äôre meant to include `readligo.py` directly in your project (as you already did earlier), **not install it via conda**.

So:
‚úÖ Remove `readligo=0.6*` from your environment file.
You‚Äôll just keep the `readligo.py` file locally in your repo.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`json` is part of Python‚Äôs standard library**

There is no separate `json` package to install ‚Äî it comes automatically with Python.
So conda will never find a `json` package.

‚úÖ Remove `json=2.0*` as well.

---

## üß≠ How to fix your environment file

Open your `environment.yml` (or whatever file you used) and **remove these two lines**:

```yaml
  - readligo=0.6*
  - json=2.0*
```

Keep the scientific stack (like `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `decorator`, `ipykernel`, etc.) and then rebuild your environment.

---

### ‚úÖ Example fixed environment.yml

Here‚Äôs a clean version you can use as a template:

```yaml
name: losc-env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - h5py
  - decorator
  - ipykernel
  - jupyterlab
```

Then recreate your environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate losc-env
```

‚úÖ This should now solve cleanly with no errors.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Optional: Verify everything works

Inside your environment:

```bash
python -c "import scipy, decorator, h5py, readligo; print('All good!')"
```

If `readligo.py` is in your repo folder, Python will import it fine.

---

Would you like me to show how to make `readligo.py` importable *automatically* when your notebook runs (so you don‚Äôt need to manually add paths each time)?
