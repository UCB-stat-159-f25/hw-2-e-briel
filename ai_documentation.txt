For assistance I used ChatGPT

Prompt: I have a remote repository via GitHub classroom and would like to add specific files from another remote repository on GitHub to it. How would I best accomplish this?

Output: Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very practical (and slightly tricky) Git workflow question.

Let‚Äôs restate your situation first:

* You have a **main remote repo** (from GitHub Classroom) ‚Äî let‚Äôs call it `origin`.
* You want to bring **specific files or folders** from **another remote GitHub repo** ‚Äî let‚Äôs call that `source-repo`.
* You **don‚Äôt want** to clone everything from `source-repo` or merge its entire history.

Here are the **best options**, depending on what you need:

---

## üß© Option 1: **Use `git sparse-checkout` with the source repo**

This is the cleanest way to pull *specific files* from another repo into your Classroom repo, while keeping full Git control.

### Steps

1. From your Classroom repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-CLASSROOM-ORG/YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO.git
   cd YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO
   ```

2. Add the other repo as a temporary remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add source https://github.com/username/source-repo.git
   ```

3. Use sparse-checkout to pull only what you need:

   ```bash
   git fetch source
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/
   git checkout source/main -- path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/
   ```

4. Commit and push the imported files to your Classroom repo:

   ```bash
   git add path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/
   git commit -m "Add selected files from source-repo"
   git push origin main
   ```

‚úÖ *Pros:*

* Only downloads specific files.
* Keeps clean commit history in your repo.
* Doesn‚Äôt clone or merge the entire source repo.

‚ùå *Cons:*

* Slightly more setup.
* Requires Git ‚â• 2.25.

---

## üì¶ Option 2: **Download specific files directly and commit them**

If you don‚Äôt need to preserve history, and you only want the file contents:

1. Use `curl` or `wget` with the raw GitHub URL:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/source-repo/main/path/to/file.py
   ```

2. Then move that file into your Classroom repo directory, add, commit, and push:

   ```bash
   git add path/to/file.py
   git commit -m "Add file.py from source-repo"
   git push origin main
   ```

‚úÖ *Pros:*

* Fast and dead simple.
* Great for a few files.

‚ùå *Cons:*

* Loses commit history.
* Manual process if you need many files.

---

## üß≠ Option 3: **Use `git subtree` or `git filter-repo` (advanced)**

If you want to *preserve the file‚Äôs original history* from the source repo, you can pull it in with `git subtree` or `git filter-repo`.

For example:

```bash
git remote add source https://github.com/username/source-repo.git
git fetch source main
git subtree add --prefix=external_files source main --squash
```

‚úÖ *Pros:*

* Keeps history (or a squashed version).
* Good if you‚Äôll update those files later from the source.

‚ùå *Cons:*

* More complex, overkill if you just want to copy files once.

Would you like me to show a **copy-pasteable example** using real folder names (e.g., importing a folder like `utils/` or a file like `data/cleaner.py` from another GitHub repo into your Classroom repo)? That would make it crystal clear.

Prompt: Is path/to/file1.py path/to/folder/ a specific command or is it something general that I need to fill out/define myself?

Output: Excellent question ‚Äî and it‚Äôs an important one üëç

üëâ `path/to/file1.py` and `path/to/folder/` are **not literal commands** ‚Äî they‚Äôre **placeholders** that **you replace** with the *actual paths* of the files or folders you want to copy from the other repository.

---

### üí° Example

Let‚Äôs say the repository you want to pull from is:

```
https://github.com/exampleuser/cool-project
```

and inside it, you want to copy these:

```
cool-project/src/utils/math_tools.py
cool-project/data/example_data/
```

Then the commands would look like this:

```bash
git sparse-checkout set src/utils/math_tools.py data/example_data/
git checkout source/main -- src/utils/math_tools.py data/example_data/
```

Here:

* `src/utils/math_tools.py` ‚Üí is the **actual file path** in the source repo.
* `data/example_data/` ‚Üí is the **actual folder path** in the source repo.

---

### üß≠ How to find the correct path

1. Go to the file or folder on GitHub.
2. Look at the URL ‚Äî for example:

   ```
   https://github.com/exampleuser/cool-project/blob/main/src/utils/math_tools.py
   ```

   The part after `blob/main/` is your path:

   ```
   src/utils/math_tools.py
   ```

That‚Äôs what you insert into the command.

---

### üß© Quick recap

| Placeholder        | You replace it with                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `path/to/file1.py` | the exact relative path to the file you want   |
| `path/to/folder/`  | the exact relative path to the folder you want |

---

Would you like to tell me the exact repo and files you want to import (just the GitHub URLs)?
I can show you the *exact commands* you‚Äôd run with those filled in correctly.

Prompt: This is the repo I want to pull from https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial.git and I would like to pull the files BBH_events_v3.json
GW150914_4_template.hdf5
H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5
L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 
as well as the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb notebook and the readligo.py utility file.

Output: Perfect üëç ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very clear setup. You have your **GitHub Classroom repo** (your working repository) and you want to **pull 6 specific files** from:

üëâ [`https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial`](https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial)

Here‚Äôs exactly how to do this cleanly **without cloning the entire source repo**, using a single `git sparse-checkout` workflow.

---

## ‚úÖ **Option 1: Git sparse-checkout method (recommended if you want to preserve Git use)**

### Step-by-step

1. Go to (or clone) your **GitHub Classroom repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-CLASSROOM-ORG/YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO.git
cd YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO
```

2. Add the LOSC tutorial repo as a **temporary remote**:

```bash
git remote add losc https://github.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial.git
```

3. **Fetch** from that remote (so you can access its files):

```bash
git fetch losc
```

4. Initialize **sparse-checkout**:

```bash
git sparse-checkout init --cone
```

5. Tell Git which files you want (these are the *exact paths* in that repo):

```bash
git sparse-checkout set \
    BBH_events_v3.json \
    GW150914_4_template.hdf5 \
    H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb \
    readligo.py
```

6. **Check out** those files from the `main` branch of the LOSC repo:

```bash
git checkout losc/main -- \
    BBH_events_v3.json \
    GW150914_4_template.hdf5 \
    H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5 \
    LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb \
    readligo.py
```

7. **Commit and push** the files into your Classroom repo:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add LOSC tutorial files from gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial"
git push origin main
```

‚úÖ Done!
Now those files are part of your GitHub Classroom repository, without cloning or merging the entire tutorial repo.

---

## üß© **Option 2: Simple one-off download (no Git integration)**

If you just want the files, you can also directly download them with `curl`:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/BBH_events_v3.json
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/GW150914_4_template.hdf5
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gwosc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial/main/readligo.py
```

Then move them into your Classroom repo folder and push as usual.

‚ùóNote:
Some `.hdf5` binary files are large ‚Äî if you use `curl`, make sure your connection doesn‚Äôt time out or truncate them.

## üß≠ Recommendation

| Goal                   | Best Method              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Keep using Git cleanly | ‚úÖ Sparse-checkout method |
| Quick manual copy      | ‚ö° Curl download          |

Would you like me to show a small **Bash script** version that automates this sparse-checkout process (so you can rerun it easily in the future)?
